A SIMPLE pomodoro timer at the moment.

Still a work-in-progress, but as of 30 April 2018 can be used and run from a Unix-based command-line interface. I'm working on porting this to an optional and richer cross-platform GUI with a lot more features, but the CLI version will also continue to have features added and be improved upon for those who prefer using the CLI (yes we do exist).

Feel free to try it out! All that is needed is the pomodoro.py file and only python 3.6+ is supported due to the use of f-strings.

Feedback, suggestions, bug-reporting, and critizism is welcome!!
